This is a working demo from a series of Office Hours I did in a Python course. The goal was to show students how to create a full stack CRUD app while incorporating an external API. 

The API we used was a free Pokemon API which gave the students experience working with both Python and JavaScript using JSON. Flask was the framework we used for this course which is more minimlaistic.
